#### Description

For the first feature, your company wants you to design a module for the search engine that can be used to store and fetch words efficiently. This module will act as a dictionary with insert and search functionalities. Moreover, this dictionary should also have a feature for searching whether a given prefix exists in the dictionary or not. This feature can be represented by the startsWith function because a prefix comes at the beginning of the word.

Letâ€™s say we insert the following words in the dictionary: the, a, there, answer, any, by, bye, their, and abc by calling the insertWord() function. Then, by calling the searchWord() function with input, there should return true. Similarly, calling the startsWith() function with the prefix by should also return true.
